The spotify playlist downloader is something I had to develop in order to skip having to download every single song from my Spotify playlist, since my car had its Android Auto not working.
But, the day after "finishing" the code, my Android Auto began working again.

The code is very rough still, missing some very important parts, such as:
  1. Removing the line after reading and downloading each song
  2. Dealing when the playlist_tracks.txt has a title with / in it, making the program stop working
  3. Figuring out how to get more API requests without having to google minced beef recipes (?)
